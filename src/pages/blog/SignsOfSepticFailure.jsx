      <section id="sign1">
        <h2>1. Slow Draining Fixtures</h2>
        <p>When multiple drains in your home are slow or sluggish, it could indicate a problem with your septic system. This is often one of the earliest warning signs that shouldn't be ignored.</p>
        <div className="warning-box">
          <strong>Warning:</strong> Don't use chemical drain cleaners as they can damage your septic system and mask underlying problems.

      <section id="sign2">
        <h2>2. Gurgling Sounds</h2>
        <p>Unusual sounds from pipes, drains, or toilets often indicate that your septic system is struggling to manage waste water. These sounds occur when air is trapped in the lines due to blockages or system failures.</p>

      <section id="sign3">
        <h2>3. Sewage Odors</h2>
        <p>Foul smells around your drain field or inside your home are never normal. These odors indicate that waste isn't being properly processed and could be backing up into your system.</p>
